    # The dashboard keeps its data (projects, groups, port) next to the script by
    # default. Under Homebrew that directory is replaced on every upgrade, so point
    # it at the same place install.sh uses -- one location whichever way it was
    # installed, and upgrades leave your groups alone.

      Start it in the background:
        brew services start agent-hud

      Then open http://127.0.0.1:7717

      To have projects appear in the dashboard as you work, add a SessionStart
      hook to ~/.claude/settings.json:

        "hooks": {
          "SessionStart": [
            { "hooks": [ { "type": "command",
              "command": "agent-hud --register \\"$PWD\\" >/dev/null 2>&1" } ] }
          ]
        }

      The hook does not start a server; it only tells a running one which folder
      you are in. You can also add folders from the dashboard itself.

      From a terminal:
        agent-hud groups               list groups
        agent-hud apply <group>        apply one to the current folder

      Data (projects, groups) lives in ~/.claude/tools/agent-hud and survives
      upgrades. Set AGENT_HUD_HOME to move it.
